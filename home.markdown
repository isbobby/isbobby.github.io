# Computer Science and More
A strong foundation in computer science is crucial for success in the field.

This blog is inspired by [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), 

it is also inspired by some quotes that are thrown around too often:

> Albert Einstein — "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough," 

> Richard Feynman — 'What I cannot build. I do not understand.'

Hence, this blog aims to explain CS concepts and problems, and document the process of building solutions around these concepts and problems.

# Main Areas of Study
### [Operating System](https://isbobby.github.io/2-os/)
Why? Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.

### [Computer Network](https://isbobby.github.io/3-network/)
Why? Imagine living without the internet.

### [Data Structure and Algorithms](https://isbobby.github.io/4-algorithms/)
Why? They are necessary for solving complex problems, and they are fun.
